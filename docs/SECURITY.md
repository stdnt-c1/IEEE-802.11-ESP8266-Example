# Security Considerations

## ⚠️ Important Security Warnings

This document outlines critical security considerations for using the ESP8266 IEEE 802.11 Management Frame Toolkit.

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance

1. **Authorization Requirements**
   - All testing MUST be performed on networks you own or have explicit permission to test
   - Unauthorized network interference may violate local and international laws
   - Obtain necessary permits for radio frequency transmission

2. **Potential Risks**
   - Management frame transmission can disrupt network operations
   - Improper use may affect nearby wireless devices
   - Frame spoofing could trigger security alerts on monitored networks

### Technical Security Considerations

1. **Channel Management**
   - Monitor RSSI levels before transmission
   - Avoid interference with critical wireless infrastructure
   - Use appropriate transmission power settings

2. **Frame Construction**
   - Validate all frame parameters before transmission
   - Use appropriate sequence numbers
   - Follow IEEE 802.11-2016 standard specifications

3. **Operating Environment**
   - Test in RF-isolated environments when possible
   - Monitor for unintended interference
   - Document all testing procedures

### Best Practices

1. **Before Testing**
   - Verify network ownership/permission
   - Check local regulations
   - Set up isolated test environment
   - Document intended test procedures

2. **During Testing**
   - Monitor system logs
   - Watch for interference
   - Use debug mode for verification
   - Keep transmission power minimal

3. **After Testing**
   - Verify network restoration
   - Document any issues
   - Clear all sensitive parameters

### Incident Response

If unintended interference occurs:
1. Immediately stop transmissions
2. Document the incident
3. Assess any impact
4. Take corrective actions
5. Update testing procedures

## Responsible Usage Agreement

By using this toolkit, you agree to:
1. Comply with all applicable laws
2. Test only on authorized networks
3. Follow security best practices
4. Report vulnerabilities responsibly
5. Accept all responsibility for usage
